VPlan
=====

VPlan is a substitution plan for german schools, also known as "Vertretungsplan".
It shows changes made in the usual timetable of students by day and class.
This is an attempt to make a universal app, that holds the same format and layout for multiple schools.
The first school implemented was Ziehenschule Frankfurt am Main, my school, and I plan to add many more over time.
A previous version of the app was ZS Plan, wish was just for Ziehenschule and can be found [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.nilsstrelow.ziehenschulevertretungsplan).
There is a [beta Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/116677531626306143784). You can join and download the beta.

## Mechanism
The substitution plans are downloaded from their respective school sites and formatted to a CSV-File on an external server. From there on VPlan checks if plans have been added or changed and downloads them onto the device.
